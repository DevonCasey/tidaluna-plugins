            ## Tidarr Integration Plugin

            Send tracks and albums from Tidal directly to Tidarr for download.

            Should be natively in the TidalLuna store, but you can install it manually:

            ### Installation
            1. Open TidalLuna
            2. Go to **Settings** -> **Plugins**
            3. Click "Install from URL"
            4. Paste: `https://github.com/DevonCasey/tidal-luna-plugins/releases/download/latest/store.json`
          files: ./dist/**
          fail_on_unmatched_files: false
